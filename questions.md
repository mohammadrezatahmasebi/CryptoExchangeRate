# Answers to Technical Questions

## 1. Time Spent and Possible Improvements
I spent approximately **6-8 hours** on the coding assignment, ensuring that best practices such as **clean architecture, SOLID principles, proper error handling, logging, caching, authentication, and API resilience** were implemented.

If I had more time, I would:
- Add **unit tests** using xUnit and Moq.
- Add **integration tests** using xUnit and Moq.
- Improve **database handling** by using a persistent storage solution.

## 2. Most Useful Feature in the Latest Version of .NET 8
One of the most useful features in **.NET 8** is the **Native AOT (Ahead-Of-Time Compilation)**, which improves application performance and reduces startup time.

### Example Usage:
```csharp
[System.Runtime.CompilerServices.SkipLocalsInit]
public class SampleClass
{
    public void Run()
    {
        Span<int> numbers = stackalloc int[5] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        Console.WriteLine(numbers[0]);
    }
}
```

## 3. Tracking Down a Performance Issue in Production
To track down performance issues, I follow these steps:
1. **Monitor logs** using **Serilog **.
3. **Profile the application** with **dotnet-trace** and **dotnet-counters**.


Yes, I have done this before. In one case, a memory leak in a long-running service was identified using **dotMemory**, and I optimized the garbage collection strategy to fix it.

## 4. Latest Technical Book or Conference
The latest book I read was **"Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin**. It reinforced the importance of designing **scalable, maintainable, and loosely coupled applications**.

I also attended the **.NET Conf 2023**, where I learned about **.NET 8's performance optimizations, Blazor enhancements, and AI integration with ML.NET**.

## 5. Thoughts on This Technical Assessment
I found this assessment **well-structured and relevant**. It allowed me to showcase my skills in **API development, security, resilience, and best practices**. I particularly liked the **real-world problem-solving approach** and the focus on **code quality and maintainability**.
